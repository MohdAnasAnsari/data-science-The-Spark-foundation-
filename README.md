# Student Scores Analysis with Linear Regression

This project demonstrates how to analyze student performance data (study hours and scores) using **Linear Regression**. The aim is to determine the optimal study hours required to achieve maximum marks. In addition to the regression analysis, the project explores statistical measures such as mean, median, and other key metrics to understand the dataset better.

## Introduction

The dataset contains information about students' study hours and their respective scores. The goal of the project is to:
- Predict student scores based on their study hours using **Linear Regression**.
- Visualize and interpret the relationship between study hours and scores.
- Provide insights using statistical analysis (e.g., mean, median).

## Features

1. **Data Analysis**:  
   - Calculated statistical measures like mean, median, and mode.  
   - Visualized the dataset using scatter plots and regression lines.  

2. **Linear Regression Model**:  
   - Built and trained a simple linear regression model.  
   - Predicted scores based on input study hours.  

3. **Data Visualization**:  
   - Scatter plot showing the relationship between study hours and scores.  
   - Regression line to demonstrate predictions.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-link>
   cd <your-repo-directory>
   
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
  ```python
   python -m venv venv  
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/MacOS  
   venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
```

3. Install the required dependencies:
  ```python
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Open the Python script (student_score_analysis.py) or Jupyter Notebook (analysis.ipynb) to explore the analysis and results.

To run predictions:

1. Input the number of study hours.
2. Observe the predicted score based on the regression model.
3. Visualizations will automatically be generated as part of the analysis.

Project Outputs
Statistical Insights:

1. Mean, median, and mode of study hours and scores.
2. Correlation between study hours and scores.
3. Visualizations:

Scatter plot of study hours vs. scores.
Regression line to depict the trend.
Predictions:

Suggested optimal study hours for maximizing scores.
Future Improvements
Integrate more advanced regression techniques like polynomial regression for better accuracy.
Add real-time prediction functionality using a web interface.
Enhance data visualization with interactive plots using Plotly or Dash.
